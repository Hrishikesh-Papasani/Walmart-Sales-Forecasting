# Walmart Sales Forecasting

## Introduction

This project aims to identify various patterns and features that impact Walmart's sales and demand. By deriving key insights that influence sales, we develop a predictive model to forecast future demand based on given features.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover purchasing patterns and identify peak sales periods.
- **SQL Analysis:** Leveraged SQL for advanced data queries and extracting key insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Implemented feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developed and evaluated multiple predictive models to forecast future sales. The tuned model achieved an R² score of 0.9751.
- **Data Visualization:** Generated a variety of plots and charts to facilitate better understanding and communication of the data.
